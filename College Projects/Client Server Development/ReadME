**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

Breaking down the assignment into sections helped tremendously. Creating the CRUD python file in a previous module allowed for a much better understanding of the project. Separating the database logic from the application, ensuring changes wouldn't impact another was huge. Modulirazing my code allowed for better adaptations of my project. This also can be used in future projects implementing this CRUD object.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

When approaching a problem I start by understanding the requirements. Breaking down into many smaller tasks and using items like kanban boards to help with this. While this project required a holistic view and integrated multiple components.  In the future when creating databases for clients, I'd emphasize flexibile design to accomodate changes, flexibility into other databases, and using modern tools for security and backups.


**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computer scientists analyze problems, designs, and use tools to create and realize the solutions. This is such a crucial part as it takes the imagination, and takes the innovation, efficiency/automation, and productivity and creates a solution. For instance with the project I worked on for Grazioso Salvare, the project I worked on provided a streamlined, efficient, user-friendly solution for the customer. Driving data management allowing the client to improve decision making, reducing errors, and overall having greater business outcomes, even profitability.
