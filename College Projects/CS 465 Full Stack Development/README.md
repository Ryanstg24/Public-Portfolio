**Architecture**

Frontend Development Comparison:
In this full stack project, we utilized both traditional and modern frontend development approaches. Express HTML provided a robust and dynamic way to serve pages, whereas JavaScript enabled interactivity and dynamic content updates. The SPA model was particularly beneficial in providing a seamless user experience, allowing for instant rendering of content without the need to refresh the entire page. The SPA model, combined with JavaScripts capabilities, ensured that my application was responsive and user-friendly.

Choice of NoSQL MongoDB:
The backend leveraged a NoSQL MongoDB database primarily due to its flexibility and scalability. Unlike relational databases, MongoDB allows for better flexible schema design, which was suitable for our project as it could and did evolve over time. Additionally, its document-oriented structure made it easier to store and retrieve complex data structures, enhancing the efficiency and speed of this application.

**Functionality**

Difference Between JSON and JavaScript:
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format, while JavaScript is a programming language. JSON is a subset of JavaScript and provides a standardized format for data transmission. In this project, JSON played a pivotal role in tying together frontend and backend development. It served as the primary medium for data exchange between the client and server, ensuring consistent and structured data communication.

Code Refactoring and Reusable UI Components:
During the development process, there was several areas where code could be optimized. For instance consolidating repetitive API calls into reusable functions and enhanced error handling. Also having a component based architecture for the user interface, allowing us to reuse UI components across different sections of the application. This not only reduced redundancy but also ensured a consistent look and feel throughout the application.

**Testing**

API Testing and Security:
In this full stack application, ensuring the integrity and functionality of the endpoints was paramount. We could have employed various types of API testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, to ensure the behavior of our endpoints was acting correctly. With the introduction of security features, particularly for admin authentication, testing became more intricate. Epsecially to ensure the endpoints were only accessible with valid authentication tokens and that potential security vulnerabilities were addressed.

**Reflection**

Course Impact on Professional Goals:
This course has been instrumental in refining my full stack development skills. By building a comprehensive web application from scratch, I've gained hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development, database management, and security best practices. The ability to design, develop, and deploy a secure and functional web application makes me a more versatile and marketable candidate in this tech industry. The skills honed in this course, such as efficient database management, secure authentication methods, and code optimization, will undoubtedly serve as valuable assets in my professional journey moving forward.
