Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The work in this project gave me a partially completed pirate intelligent agent. I was responsible for applying key concepts in reinforcement learning and neural networks
in this real world problem. The goal was for the game to be completed and won for finding a route to the "treausre". It was effective when the game solves the route in an
effective and efficient manner. Using my knowledge throughout this class of neural networks I was able to effectively apply this concept and create a successful game. This
can be reflected for deeper real-world problems in the future with this basic understanding.

**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:**

***What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?***

Computer scientists design, develop, and analyze algorithms and data structures to solve complex problems, and their work forms the backbone of modern technology. 
By learning current/emerging trends in this course, especially the advancements in AI, we gain insights into the rapidly evolving landscape of 
computer science and its impact on various sectors.

***How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?***

Approaching a problem I try to understand the problem/task at hand first. Then breaking down the problem/task into much more manageable tasks. Using logical reasoning,
algorithmic thinking, and understanding the tools at hand to solve the problem. All while optimizing and solving the problem efficiently.

***What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?***

In anything I work on and as a computer scientist you are responsible for the safety, privacy, and fairness in the software and systems to the end user. All while holding the
integrity and objectives of the organization, while being transparent about potential risks and biases, ensuring that technology is used responsibly and does not cause harm.
